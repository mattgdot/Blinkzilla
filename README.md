# ðŸ•’ Blinkzilla: Break Reminder App

**Blinkzilla** helps you take regular breaks from your screen to prevent digital eye strain. Every few minutes, it reminds you to pause, look away, and give your eyes a chance to rest. You might take a breath, look out the window, or grab a glass of water â€” just something simple to reset.

## About the project

Blinkzilla is my first app built entirely with **Jetpack Compose**. It started as a personal project to learn the framework, but turned into something genuinely useful.

The app is based on the **20-20-20 rule** â€” every 20 minutes, look at something 20 feet away for 20 seconds. You choose your reminder interval, and Blinkzilla takes care of the rest.

Itâ€™s minimal, ad-supported, and free to use on all Android devices.

## How to build

To build the project locally:

1. Create a file called `apikey.properties` in the root of the project.
2. Add the following keys:

   ```
